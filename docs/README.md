# Notes
## Who is "Sayabee"?
Her real name is Sahya Kobayashi, and "Sayabee" is her nickname.  
She is a virtual Japanese pop idol created in a tv program "Ai-Chara(アイキャラ)" which is broadcasted by NTV (NIPPON TV).  
  
In this TV program, its MC members: BAKARHYTHM, Keisuke Koide (Base Ball Bear), and Nemu Yumemi (Dempagumi.inc) talked who are japanese pop idol characters they prefer to create,  
and decided her attributes are *28 years old and late-bloomer* on Jan. 13, 2016.  
Then they called for entry the original picture of her visual to the audience, and only a week later select the image from all entries.  
At the same time they also decided her name "Sahya Kobayashi" and other detailed characteristics.  
  
After her key visual and characteristics are settled, MC and production crews held the audition of her character voice (for amateurs only)
and ordered a famous 3DCG creator "Kio" to make her 3DCG model and animation with MMD (MikuMikuDance).  
Furthermore, tv crews had a plan to **produce her debut sing and music video**, 
therefore they requested producer Kota OhKouchi and composer and lyricist Tomoharu Moriya to her song, 
and choreographer Yumiko to her dance, whom they considered the best members.  
  
Finally, on Mar. 30, 2016, they completed to make her debut song and music video.
Of course, her voice actor, who had passed the audition, recorded her singing voice with some signature phrases.
Her debut song was actually sold via online store.  
  
Now she is making her much effort to become a famous pop idol, let's cheer her so that her dream comes true.  
For more information, check the [Officital Page](http://www.ntv.co.jp/ichara/, "Ai-Chara official") just now (sorry, it's Japanese Only).
